# Project Summary

https://www.oregon.gov/odot/Safety/Documents/Pedestrian_Safety_and_Social_Equity.pdf  
The data and scripts in this project gather Census data and then calculates a Race, Ethnicity, and Income Index (REII) using a standardized score method, also referred to as a z-score.  Using Oregon DOT crash data this project then calculates
pedestrain injury rates for each REII category to demonstrate that communities with a higher concentration of poverty and/or BIPOC populations have a higher rates of pedestrian injury.
